# GenConHotelWatch
A small application to watch for Gen Con Hotel openings and send notifications.

This was optimized for 2016. I'm not attending 2017 so I haven't been able to do any testing.

Credit should definitely go to https://github.com/mrozekma whose Python version of https://github.com/mrozekma/gencon-hotel-check inspired this project. Check out his version which is up-to-date.
